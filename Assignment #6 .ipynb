    "## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
    ">Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language model in which programs are organized around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior. Examples of an object can range from physical entities, such as a human being that is described by properties like name and address. In which Human is class and its functions are objects which make that class.\n",
    ">further there are artributes and behavior like ear is atribute and listening is its behavior.\n"
